# hitbtc
HitBTC Websocket API 2.0 Client written in Python 3.

This client is a fork, we have replaced the use of some libraries to get performance improvements:

## Replaced libraries
+ [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) by [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#performance)

The client supplies data both visually via console, as well as python objects via its `HitBTC.recv()`.
It's important to note that this does not receive data from the API directly -
instead, the data is pulled from a `queue.Queue` object, which defaults to a length of
100 items. So only the last 100 messages will be cached - either make sure you process the messages
fast enough, or increas the length of the queue (can be done by passing the `q_maxsize` kwarg on
instantiation).

By default, data is unpacked - that means you will never see the raw `JSONRPC` message
(this, too, can be turned off by passing `raw=True` upon initialization). This will, however, also
turn off all handling of error messages etc.

For an in-depth description of the client and its methods, please see the documenation at

# Installation

Stable: `pip install hitbtc`
Release Candidate: `pip install --pre hitbtc`

# Example Usage

```python
import time
import queue
from hitbtc import HitBTC
c = HitBTC()
c.start()  # start the websocket connection
time.sleep(2)  # Give the socket some time to connect
c.subscribe_ticker(symbol='ETHBTC') # Subscribe to ticker data for the pair ETHBTC

while True:
    try:
        data = c.recv()
    except queue.Empty:
        continue

    # process data from websocket
    ...

c.stop()
```
